# Abtracts Folder

The abstract file contains all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.

The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.

This **Abstracts** folder contains the following files:
* **_functions.scss** - Functions for evaluating source code across our variables, maps, and mixings
* **_mixings.scss** - Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet
* **_variables.scss** - Assign a value to a name that begins with $, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself
